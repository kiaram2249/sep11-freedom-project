#### MVP

**Background/Details:**

* [ ] We need to start planing how we want our game to look like. We need to designs how background for the game.
   * Caron will be designing the background that we need. We should have a background for the intro of the game, and for the setting background for the mini/main game.
   * The background design should be done during the mid-winter break on February 15,2025 - Feburary 23, 2025.
   * She will also being working on small details for the game to become more intersting and something that people would catch their eye on March 1-4,2025.

**Crops/Farm:**
 
* [ ] For the main game, Robert and Kiara will slowly start making the farm. The farm is where the user will grow their crops in order to make profit in the end of the game from February 23 - March 23, 2025.
  * [ ] Make the field and crop plots first from Feb. 23 - Mar. 1.
  * [ ] Then we make the farm, extra plants and other stuff. March 1 - 23.
   * [ ] We need to come to a decision if we want to set a limit of **vegtables** or **fruits**, that the user can crop. 
   * Maybe we can such a limit in only 3 items that they can pick. (ex: The user can pick either 1 fruit: 2 vegtables, 2 fruits: 1 vegtable, or only having one for all 3).
   * [ ] Robert and Kiara should slowly start making this thoughout mid-winter break. I say we should have at least one crop/farm. (At least have 1 or 2 done) on March 11, 2025.
    * [ ] Coding crop growth and adding crop value.

**Marketplace:**

 * [ ] If we all can, we need to start to make the stand/marketplace so that the user can sell their **fruits/vegtables**. 

#### Beyond MVP

* [ ] Make multiple levels to the game.
* [ ] Make a Town, Forest, etc.
* [ ] Make a mini story mode as the introduction.
