### Content

Last year in **SEP 10** the people who were in that class had to do a **Freedom Project**, everyone had to make a website. Now that I am in **SEP 11**, I will be doing the samething. I'll be making a **game** with my two partner as our **Freedom Project**. However, this year everyone is learning new different tools, different tools from last years, and some examples of the tools are **Kaboom**, **P5play**, **Phaser**, **Two.js**, **3D**, and many more other tools. So, for this years **Freedom Project** my partners (_Robert & Caron_) will be making a **Garden Game**, and each of us are using/learning different tools in order to make this game possible.

### P5play

**P5play** is the tool that I will learn/tinker over these months, so that I can use the skills that I learnt to incorporate to our **Garden Game**. I wanted to learn **P5play** because it's a JavaScript libary that develops/uses dynamic and physics-based animation, simulation, and games. As well I thought this will be useful to incorporate into our game. However, right now I did two learning.logs: ([My learning.log](https://github.com/kiaram2249/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md)), and I have somewhat of little knowledage in how to use **P5play**. The way that I tinker with **P5play** is that I go to the [P5play](https://p5play.org/) website and I use [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/kiaram2249/sketches/VtfUHQrwN) to tinker. I will always use this two sources because in the **P5play** website it have many examples, many variables that I can use, and little mini challenges if you want to do them. However, while using this two sources, I was also using **YouTube** to find videos about **P5play**. One of my peers, who is also doing **P5play**, shared me a video that talks about **P5play**. They shared me a video that was made from [David Bouchard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ23FHfgA0A). This video really did help me because he talked about different kinds of variables that he used, and what those variable do. So far this is my way of thinkering/learning in how to use **P5play**.

### The Garden Game

When **Caron**, **Robert** and I were thinking about what game to make, it was very hard to do so. First we wanted to make a game where that you have to defeat other characters in order to go to the next level. However, we were adding to many ideas just for that one little game, so we drop that idea and came up with another one. The next thing that we thought to do was a game in where you make potions. We were all talking about that idea, but for some reason we kept on going towards with food, or something that invalues with foods. I don't know how, but we ended my with the idea of a **Garden Game**. The **Garden game** will be about in just how the title says, the players will be creating/making a garden, and they would have to take care of their garden from pests/insects. Once they grew out their fruits and vegtables they can pick those out from the garden and then sell them. Almost like the players have to take care of their garden so that they can use those fruits/vegtables to sell in there market. 

### Engineering Design Process

Right now I'm at step 2, _researching_, I really wouldn't say that I am in step 1 as well because I'm not to sure if I am defining a problem, or defining something in general. However, I do know that I am in step 2 because I have to do research about my tool, **P5play**, I need to find sources or even videos that I can use so that I can be able to tinker/learn my tool. I should also consider step 3, _brainstorm_, because my partners and I need to have a heads up in what we want to brainstorm about. We need to brainstorm about the outlook for our game, the factors, the way in how the players will play the game, and can we make in active, etc. But, I won't go that deep into step 3 just yet, but it's a good thing to think about over time and when that day actually comes. 

### Skills

##### Collaboration

I will be learning the skill **collaboration** because this years freedom project, I will be working with my partners in order to make the game. I need to learn this skill because we all need to be working together, it can't be just one person doing all the work. That would be unfair to my parnters and I. That's why I really want to focus or even to remind myself that **collaboration** is key in order for us to make the **Garden Game**. 

##### How to learn

How to **learn** is an important skill that I need to know because I need to learn how to use my tool. I need to find sources and examples of **P5play** so that I can master in how to use it. If I don't learn how to use my tool, at the end of the year, I won't be able to know how to use my tool for our **Freedom Project**. I don't want to repeat like last year, when I was in **SEP 10**, in were I didn't learnt my tool enough. I want to able to learn enough about my tool, so that I can know which variables I can use for the **Freedom Project**. 

##### Communication

**Communication** is very important because one of our partner (_Robert_) is in **SEP 11** period 4, while _Caron_ and I are in **SEP 11** period 3. So, **communication** is very important for us because we all need to be at the same steps/the same part so that no one will be behind or ahead. However, **communication** is important because if we wanted to work on the project at home during the weekends/holidays, we need to stay in touch with each other. That's why when we were in our first week talking about the **Freedom Project** I made a group chat in **Discord** because we all have **discord** and we all use it as well. We can use that when we are at home or outside of school. But when we can in school, we can all use **Slack** to communicate. Even we be on **slack** on different periods/times, this will be a way for all of to send updates in what we did, any questions that we have, and plan out our next steps.
