So far I have been able to learn new things about my tool [P5play](https://p5play.org/). I have been tinkering for one month probably a half by now, and I have learnt so much about my tool. For inctance, the first time that I was tinkering I wanted to have a sense about the **Sprites**, because in order for me to make shape for example I would have to need a **sprite**. This was a huge thing for me to learn about because when I was going in depth of **P5play**, I realized that **sprites** is important and that **sprites** is needed for everything. I say this because the next thing that I learnt was **sprite.collider** , **sprite.moveTo(mouseX, mouseY)**, and adding text inside of the shape or sprite. It's important that I need how to do this because it can help with my groups **Freedom Project**. Also, lastly I was able to learn how to set a **backgroud** by using **sprites** and how to set a little character by using a **sprite** as well. However, all of these coding and the different **sprites** that I was able to learn by tinkering will come in handy because while I was learning about these factors/technique, I was ready thinking about how I can incorporate these into the game.
