    This year in **SEP**, I had the opportunity to learn and develop a variety of new problem-solving skills and new coding skills that helped me grow as a student and a creator. Throughout the year, I worked with my tool like **P5play**, and learnt **JavaScript**, **p5js**, **DOM**, and new functions that could bring cool features throughout my junior year of **SEP**. One of the most challenging, but also rewarding experiences was teaching myself how to use **P5play**, a libary I explored on my own to help build interactive elements in our game. All of these skills came togther in our final **Freedom Project**, where my partners and I created a game from scratch. Everything I learned throughout the year helped us bring our vision to life and collaborate effectively as a team. 
  
    While learning about my tool, it taught me how to actually **Google** better, how to **debug** my code when things broke, and how to **keep trying** different solutions until something worked. Also, working with other people helped me grow a lot. I got a bit better at **communicating**, **collaborating**, **managing my time**, and **paying attention** to details. Especially when we were trying to meet deadlines or fix bugs together. Being part of a team really taught me how important it is to stay **organized** and make sure everyone was always on the same page. 
  
  Another big part of **SEP** was presenting our work to others. At first, I was super nervous about talking in front of people, but by the end, I felt way more confident. I'm very grateful that Mr.Mueller made our class to present to each other because that really did help me feel prepare for the **EXPO**. It helped me learn how to explain my ideas clearly, speak up, and handle questions without freezing up. Overall, this year taught me a lot, and not just about coding, but also about working with people, problem-solving and expressing myself. This is why I am glad that I decided to take **SEP**, even though I had lots of challenges. But these challenges help me shape up as a student and made me learn made skills that I won't forget. 

### EXPO
**(My thought/feeling on it and what I want to do better for next year):**

  Doing the **EXPO** made me nervous, even though I also did it last year in **SEP 10**. I feel like I’ll probably always get nervous before an **EXPO**, and I know my partners felt the same way. But overall, I’m glad we get the chance to do it every year, because it really makes me reflect on my glows and grows, the things I’m proud of and the areas I want to keep improving.
  Next year, when I go into my senior year, it's going to be my last **EXPO** at **HSTAT**, and that really means a lot to me. It means a lot to me because I want to make it count by creating a **Freedom Project** that has a real purpose, something helpful for people. I want it to be something meaninggul that I can be very proud of. I alos want to improve the way I present. I want to feel more confident, be better at thinking on my feet when the judges ask questions, and feel really prepared going into it. SInce it'll be my last **EXPO**, I want to push myself to do my best and end my **SEP** journey strong.
