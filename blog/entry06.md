### Content

This year in **SEP**, I had the opportunity to learn and develop a variety of new problem-solving skills and new coding skills that helped me grow as a student. Throughout the year, I worked with my tool like **P5play**, and learnt **JavaScript**, **p5js**, **DOM**, and new functions that could bring cool features throughout my junior year of **SEP**. One of the most challenging, but also rewarding experiences was teaching myself how to use **P5play**, a libary I explored on my own to help build interactive elements in our game. All of these skills came togther in our final **Freedom Project**, where my partners and I created a game from scratch. Everything I learned throughout the year helped us bring our vision to life and collaborate effectively as a team. 
  
While learning about my tool, it taught me how to actually **Google** better, how to **debug** my code when things broke, and how to **keep trying** different solutions until something worked. Also, working with other people helped me grow a lot. I got a bit better at **communicating**, **collaborating**, **managing my time**, and **paying attention** to details. Especially when we were trying to meet deadlines or fix bugs together. Being part of a team really taught me how important it is to stay **organized** and make sure everyone was always on the same page. 
  
Another big part of **SEP** was presenting our work to others. At first, I was super nervous about talking in front of people, but by the end, I felt way more confident. I'm very grateful that Mr.Mueller made our class present to each other because that really did help me feel prepare for the **EXPO**. It helped me learn how to explain my ideas clearly, speak up, and handle questions without freezing up. Overall, this year taught me a lot, and not just about coding, but also about working with people, problem-solving and expressing myself. This is why I am glad that I decided to take **SEP**, even though I had lots of challenges. But these challenges help me shape up as a student and made me learn made skills that I won't forget. 

### EXPO

Doing the **EXPO** made me nervous, even though I also did it last year in **SEP 10**. I feel like I’ll probably always get nervous before an **EXPO**, and I know my partners felt the same way. But overall, I’m glad we get the chance to do it every year, because it really makes me reflect on my glows and grows, the things I’m proud of and the areas I want to keep improving.
  
Next year, when I go into my senior year, it's going to be my last **EXPO** at **HSTAT**, and that really means a lot to me. It means a lot to me because I want to make it count by creating a **Freedom Project** that has a real purpose, something helpful for people. I want it to be something meaninggul that I can be very proud of. I alos want to improve the way I present. I want to feel more confident, be better at thinking on my feet when the judges ask questions, and feel really prepared going into it. SInce it'll be my last **EXPO**, I want to push myself to do my best and end my **SEP** journey strong.

### Engineering Design Process

Now that we’ve finished both the **Freedom Project** and the **EXPO**, I’ve officially reached ``Step 7: Improve as Needed`` and ``Step 8: Communicate the Results``. Right now, I’m taking time to **reflect** on what went well and what I could’ve done better. I’m thinking about how I can use the feedback we got during the **EXPO**, from my peers, and throughout this whole junior year to improve, not just the project itself, but also how I work and present overall. This will help me grow and be more prepared when it’s time to create my final **Freedom Project** next year.

Step 8 is especially important because presenting at the **EXPO** gave me a chance to share all the work my partners and I put in, walk people through our process, and show what I’ve learned. It felt good to communicate our results to people who were genuinely interested, and now I’m thinking about how I can do an even better job next time.

### Skills

#### Time Management

**Time management** was something I really had to focus on, especially with deadlines approaching and trying to balance the project with other schoolwork. It’s also a skill I know I still need to improve, because there were times when I left things until the last minute, and that only ended up creating more stress for me. Learning to manage my time better will help me stay more **organized** and **avoid** feeling overwhelmed in the future.

#### Communication

Learning how to **communicate** clearly with my team made everything run more smoothly, especially when we had to make quick decisions or explain our ideas. This skill was really important because one of my partners was in a different class period, so we had to find ways to stay connected outside of regular class time. The same thing applied during weekends or school breaks. We had to keep in touch to stay on track. **Communication** was a big part of our success, because without it, we probably would’ve been lost and wouldn’t have been able to complete our **Freedom Project** the way we did.

#### Collaboration

**Collaboration** was key, because we all had different strengths, and working together helped us solve problems faster and come up with better ideas. 

#### Problem Decomposition

**Problem Decomposition**, breaking down big challenges into smaller steps. It made complex tasks way more manageable, especially when coding or fixing bugs.
  
### Sources

These are some of the sources I used while learning/tinkering how to use my tool **P5play**. They helped me understand how it works and how I can apply it in our project. I’ve also included slides that my partners and I created, which helped us during our presentation and gave us a chance to reflect on the challenges we faced and the takeaways we gained throughout the process.
