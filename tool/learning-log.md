### Phaser

In order to learn **Phaser** I'm gonna watch 2-3 videos about it. These videos are provided in the **SEP11 Freedom Project Tool List**. I want to learn **Phaser** step by step, by not watching so many videos at once. I think if I limit the amount of videos that I watch each day I can probably learn my tool better. So, this is my plan in how I'm gonna learn **Phaser** and of course I will thinker/look at many demos so that I can practice and see how to do it. 

* _Part 1 Setting Up- Getting Started with Phaser 3_
  * In ths first video, it was just showing me how to get started with **Phaser**, I download **_Phaser.min.js_** into my **IDE**. I also made a touch file call **game.js** and a **index.html**.

* _Part 2 Phaser Scenes- Getting Started with Phaser 3_
  * I learnt that scenes are the places in where the elements of the game live in. **Scenes** can even be use at the same time in the same game. For instance, a scene can be use as the title screen, as a map for a game, the games setting, etc.
  * I also learnt **Init**, **Preload**, **Create**, and **Update**. These four hold important value in when making a game.
  * Arrays are link with this because you can use an array to specify as many scenes as we want.

```
Example: scene: [Scene1, Scene2]
```
```
this.add.text();

this.scene.start();
```
